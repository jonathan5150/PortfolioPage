This is my portfolio page built with React! I'm building this because I've always needed a portfolio page and I wanted to learn the React so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone. 

To run it just go to your IDE of choice, go to the console in the root directory, install NPM with "npm install" and then run it with "npm start".

If you notice any issues with my code here feel free to message me. I'm always looking to improve.
