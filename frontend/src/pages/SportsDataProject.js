         lot of friends interested in sports data and they've mentioned to me how difficult it is to
         find a webpage that has all the statistics they want to see in one place. So I figured I'd try to
         tackle the project so that I can work on my backend skills via connecting to a public API,
         storing that information in a database, and manipulating it.
